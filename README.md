# NoEspresso Vision Simulator

NoEspresso is an extension that simulates different visual impairments and demonstrates how web content would be seen through each of these impairments.

It is an updated version of Eitan Isaacson's NoCoffee Vision Simulator, which is itself an updated version of the original Aaron Leventhal's NoCoffee Vision Simulator. You can read more about it in [Aaron's post](https://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/458/).
